# Quality Control

This GitHub project provides general guidance for ensuring quality control across various wildfire and landscape risk-related projects at Forsite. It serves as a reference for developing consistent, reproducible, and high-quality outputs across different project types. The intent is to enable both specialists and non-specialists to follow standardized workflows, and to clearly identify which steps require expert oversight.

## Project Scope

The project is structured around key thematic areas:

- **Risk To**  
  Projects evaluating wildfire risk **to** infrastructure and assets.

- **Risk From**  
  Projects evaluating wildfire risk **from** infrastructure (e.g., utility corridors) to surrounding areas.

- **Landscape Risk (LANDIS-II)**  
  Projects using LANDIS-II for landscape-scale wildfire simulation and planning.

- **Exposure**  
  Exposure assessments including PODs (Potential Operational Delineations) and other geospatial exposure modeling approaches.

- **Fuel ID**  
  Projects focused on fuel identification and classification using field data, remote sensing, and modeling tools.

- **Modelling**  
  General modeling frameworks and QC guidance for:
  - **WISE**
  - **Prometheous**
  - **FlamMap**

Each section provides best practices for:
- Input data validation
- Modeling workflows
- Output QC standards

## Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Provide reusable templates and checklists for project development
- Clarify where expert judgment is essential versus where general staff can follow documented procedures
- Improve consistency and transparency across project outputs
- Support onboarding and training for new team members
- Facilitate handoff or continuation of projects when team composition changes

## Future Development

The folder `Future_development/` includes processes or modules identified as valuable but not yet implemented in previous projects, often due to time constraints. These should be prioritized for integration in future iterations.

## ATCO Example Project

An example document from the **ATCO** wildfire risk assessment project demonstrates how the quality control principles in this repository can be applied across multiple domains (e.g., Risk To, Risk From, Landscape Risk).
