## ðŸ”§ Future Improvements

This section outlines enhancements that could be implemented across different wildfire risk modeling projects:

- **BHE Project â€“ FlamMap Integration**  
  Currently, the FlamMap implementation for BHE does **not** include integration with **WindNinja**.  
  âž¤ _Action_: Update the modeling workflow and preprocessing code to support WindNinja output (e.g., dynamic wind inputs per ignition scenario).
